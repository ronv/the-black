Kirby comes as a clean package, aiming to provide you with a useful toolkit to get started with. But it it is also very modular and extensible. Rather than providing a solution to every imaginable problem out of the box, Kirby prefers to let *you* decide which features your project really needs.

There are a ton of different possibilities of how to extend Kirby. For sure, you will write your own template files (or maybe buy a theme?) and adjust the CSS according to your needs. Maybe you’ll install plugins or write your own custom Kirbytags or even Panel fields?

However, if you ever get stuck, don’t hesitate to ask your question in [our forum](https://forum.getkirby.com/). It is also a great place to connect with other Kirby developers and to discover new plugins, developed by the Kirby community.
